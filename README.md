My internship with Dr. Peggy Lindner lasted 4 weeks, where I spent 18 hours a week at the data science research lab in the University of Houston.
During the internship, my objective was to research and learn about various artificial intelligence classification algorithms and utilize them to perform text categorization like sentiment analysis and intent classification.
This repository contains the program files of my progress with using classification algorithms.
